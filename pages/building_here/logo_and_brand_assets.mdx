The typeface selected for our branding is a readable and versatile option. Our chosen font is a simple and minimalistic design that conveys professionalism yet approachability.

## Consistency with MEST Brand

The app's design also takes into consideration a pressing issue faced by MEST, emphasizing the need for a level of consistency with the MEST brand.

We believe that this thoughtfully crafted branding scheme not only enhances the user experience but also aligns with the core values and goals of our application.
