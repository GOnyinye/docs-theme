## Introduction

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is an additional layer of security that requires users to provide two different authentication factors before gaining access to their accounts. In the "Here" platform, we implement 2FA using One-Time Passwords (OTP), which are time-sensitive codes that users receive on their registered devices.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing 2FA with OTP in the "Here" platform, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- An existing user authentication system in the "Here" platform.
- Access to an OTP generation library or service.
- User data storage capable of storing OTP secret keys.

## Setting Up 2FA

### OTP Generation

1. Choose an OTP generation library or service. Popular options include [Google Authenticator](https://developers.google.com/identity/sms-retriever/overview) or open-source libraries like [Speakeasy](https://github.com/speakeasyjs/speakeasy).

2. Integrate the selected OTP generation method into your user authentication system. Generate OTP secret keys and associate them with user accounts during registration.

### User Enrollment

1. Provide a user-friendly interface for users to enable 2FA in their account settings.

2. Guide users through the process of scanning a QR code generated from their OTP secret key. This step typically involves the use of an authenticator app, such as Google Authenticator.

3. Store the user's OTP secret key securely in your database.

## Using 2FA

### Sign-In with 2FA

1. When users attempt to sign in, prompt them to enter their OTP code generated by the authenticator app.

2. Validate the OTP code by comparing it with the OTP generated on the server using the user's secret key. Allow access upon successful validation.

### Backup Codes

1. Provide users with a set of backup codes during 2FA setup. These codes can be used if they lose access to their OTP app or device.

2. Instruct users to securely store these backup codes.

3. Implement a mechanism for users to regenerate backup codes if needed.

## Disabling 2FA

1. Allow users to disable 2FA from their account settings if they choose to do so.

2. Prompt users to confirm their identity, possibly using their existing password.

## Security Considerations

- Protect OTP secret keys with strong encryption both in transit and at rest.
- Implement rate limiting and lockout mechanisms to prevent brute force attacks.
- Educate users about the importance of securing their OTP secret keys and backup codes.
