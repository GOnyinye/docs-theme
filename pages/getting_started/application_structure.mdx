## Introduction

The "Here" application is a [briefly describe the purpose and goals of the application]. To effectively contribute to or maintain the project, it's crucial to understand how the codebase is organized and structured.

## Project Structure

The "Here" application follows a structured directory layout to keep the code organized and maintainable. Below is an overview of the project structure:


# "Here" Application Structure Overview

The "Here" application is organized into the following key directories:

- **client:** Contains front-end code, including components, pages, styles, and public assets.

- **server:** Houses the back-end code, including API routes, data models, controllers, middleware, and configuration.

- **database:** Manages database setup and migrations.

- **tests:** Includes unit and integration tests.

- **scripts:** Contains build and deployment scripts.

- **public:** Holds publicly accessible assets.

This structured layout ensures organization and maintainability of the codebase for effective development and maintenance.



## Key Components

### Front-end

- **client/components:** This directory contains reusable UI components used throughout the front-end of the application.

- **client/pages:** Next.js pages and routing are defined here. Each page typically represents a different route in the application.

- **client/styles:** CSS and styling files for the front-end components are located here.

- **client/public:** This directory contains static assets such as images, fonts, and other publicly accessible files.

### Back-end

- **server/routes:** API routes and endpoint handlers are defined in this directory.

- **server/models:** Data models for interacting with the database are defined here.

- **server/controllers:** Request handlers that process client requests are located in this directory.

- **server/middleware:** Middleware functions for request processing (e.g., authentication) are defined here.

- **server/config:** Configuration files for server settings and environment variables are stored here.

## Configuration

Explain how to configure the application, including environment variables, database setup, and other configuration options.

## Development

Provide instructions for developers on how to set up and run the development environment locally. Include steps for installing dependencies and starting the development server.

## Testing

Explain the testing strategy and how to run unit and integration tests. Mention any testing frameworks or libraries used.

## Deployment

Describe the deployment process, including any scripts or tools used for deployment. Provide information on the production environment and server setup.

## Contributing

Outline guidelines for contributing to the "Here" application. Include information on how to submit bug reports, feature requests, and code contributions. Mention any code review or coding standards.
